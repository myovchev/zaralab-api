Feature: Testing Member Rest service
  In order to retrieve and manage member information through the service
  as a service user
  I want to see if the service work as expected

  Scenario: Request active member - api_member_show route
    Given I am not authenticated
    When I send a GET request to "members/1"
      Then the response code should be 200
        And the response should contain json:
        """
        {
          "id": 1,
          "first_name": "The Real",
          "last_name": "Chuck Norris",
          "email": "admin@example.com"
        }
        """
        And in the response there is no field called "mac_addresses"
        And in the response there is no field called "phone"
        And in the response there is no field called "enabled"
